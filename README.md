# HTTP-Server

In this project you will be constructing a (very) basic web (HTTP) server using Python 3. The server will serve up basic text, HTML, and JPEG files, and must produce error messages (in the responses sent back!) for a number of cases we will test. You will also write (but not turn in) some short clients (based on an example I will give) to test your server.
